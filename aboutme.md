title: About me
subtitle: Not a Poet — Just an Engineer Figuring It Out
---

My name is Ngoc Diep Nguyen, an Electrical Engineering student passionate about problem-solving, systems thinking, and the invisible forces that power our world.

- Grounded in a deep interest in RF systems, NDE, and grid control, I bring that passion into my role as PR Chair of ISU IEEE Chapter 2025–26.
- Rooted in my Vietnamese heritage, I value family, resilience, and community — which I carry into my role as Vice President of VISA 2025–26.
- Recharging through yoga and badminton, I stay balanced and focused in both study and life.

I came into EE not because I had it all figured out — but because I didn't. I followed the questions that challenged me most, and I found myself fascinated by fields like electromagnetism and power systems.

This blog is part journal, part playground — a space where I share what I learn, what confuses me, and what excites me about engineering.
