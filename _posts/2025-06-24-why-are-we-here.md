I once spent countless hours writing about Physics — even personifying it as a childhood friend. That was the theme of my 600-word university application essay. I poured all my creativity into making Physics sound poetic. But looking back, maybe it didn’t need to be beautiful. Physics simply is. And I’m not a poet — I’m someone who wants to understand it, learn from it, and apply it to real-world problems.

So… why Electrical Engineering? That’s the question people kept asking me in my first year. For many, choosing a major feels like a final, life-altering decision. But for me, it was more like a chance — a path to explore, not a fate to seal. If it didn’t fit, I’d move on. But without trying, how would I ever know?

I’ve always been drawn to electricity, electromagnetism, and their related systems — even if I’ve struggled to visualize the concepts. The harder they are to grasp, the more I want to understand them. That curiosity is what led me here.
This blog is where I’ll share what I’ve learned in RF systems, nondestructive evaluation (NDE), power systems, and grid control — not as an expert, but as a student who’s curious, struggling, and slowly figuring it all out.
Disclaimer: This is a personal learning journey. I hope it helps others who are exploring the same paths.
